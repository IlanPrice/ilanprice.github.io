    <p>Here's a brief bio about me:</p>
    <p>I am a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, where my current work is focused on using machine learning to advance weather forecasting. I completed my DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, in which I focused my research on sparsity and efficiency in deep learning. I have a relatively diverse and interdisciplinary background, including research, leadership, organizational and activist experience. Prior to the DPhil, I completed an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at Oxford, and received my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Philosophy from the University of Cape  
 Town.</p>
